## Built With
- Ruby

## Game Flow
- The players will first be welcomed into the Tic Tac Toe.
- The first player will be assigned an X.
- The second player will be assigned an O.
- Each player, during their respective turns indicated by a prompt with their name, will then be asked to enter the unfilled position at which they want to enter their tokens by entering a number from 1-9.
- An invalid move will be flagged and the player will be notified.
- When either player wins or it's a tie, GAME OVER is displayed and the game is reset.
